In this section, we provide the scripts for running the experiments in Figure 8/9 for a range of models and datasets. 
Note that for the artifact evaluation, we only provided **a small subset** of data points for easier testing. 
The test cases are generated by dumping the input data from [LongChat](https://github.com/DachengLi1/LongChat) and [LongBench](https://github.com/THUDM/LongBench).

### Mistral-7B

#### CacheGen 
Before running the encoder of CacheGen, first runs the following code to generate the KV caches. The following code generates the KV caches for the **LongChat dataset** (in Fig. 8/9) on Mistral-7B model.
Note that this assumes you have **one A40 GPU with 48GB GPU memeory**. 


```
export SAVE_DIR=.
bash scripts/7b.sh longchat 0
```

This will output CacheGen's size of KV cache on the LongChat dataset. 

If you want to test the accuracy, you need to set the **OPENAI api key** (You can obtain the key here: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
```
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR API KEY>
export SAVE_DIR=.
bash scripts/7b.sh longchat 1
```
This will output the accuracy and size of KV cache on the LongChat dataset. 

#### Baselines

To run the code of quantization and vanilla LLM inference w/o any compression, run the following, which will output the accuracy and size of KV cache on the LongChat dataset (you will need to have OPENAI api key): 

```
bash scripts/7b_baseline.sh longchat 1 
```
This will output the accuracy and size of KV cache on the LongChat dataset. 



### Llama-70B

**This requires you to have 4 A40 GPUs!**

First to run with the **longchat** dataset,  run the following code:
```
export SAVE_DIR=.
bash scripts/70b.sh longchat 0
```

If you want to test the accuracy, you need to set the **OPENAI api key**
```
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR API KEY>
export SAVE_DIR=.
bash scripts/70b.sh longchat 1
```
This will output the accuracy and size of KV cache on the LongChat dataset. 


Similarly, to run the code for the baselines on longchat, run the following code:

```
bash scripts/70b_baseline.sh longchat 1 
```

To run with the **NarrativeQA** dataset, run the following code:
```
export SAVE_DIR=.
bash scripts/70b.sh nqa 1
```
This will output the F1 score and size of KV cache on the NarrativeQA dataset. 

To run the baselines on NarrativeQA, run the following code:

```
export SAVE_DIR=.
bash scripts/70b_baseline.sh nqa 1
```
This will output the F1 score and size of KV cache on NarrativeQA dataset. 


To run with the **TriviaQA** dataset, run the following code:
```
export SAVE_DIR=.
bash scripts/70b.sh tqa 1
```
This will output the F1 score and size of KV cache on the TriviaQA dataset. 


To run the baselines on TriviaQA, run the following code:

```
export SAVE_DIR=.
bash scripts/70b_baseline.sh tqa 1
```
This will output the F1 score and size of KV cache on TriviaQA dataset. 


### Adaptation

To run the adaptation algorithm of CacheGen's streamer, run the following code:

```
export SAVE_DIR=.
bash scripts/adapt.sh 
```
